# code-practices
My code, data science, and machine learning practices begin from 2023 Aug.

In the car_rent_platform, it was my first time using Class in Python.
  The relevant code and material:

In the Cohorts of Songs project, I used Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for EDA and Cluster Analysis.
  The relevant code, data, and material:

In the ScienceQtech project, I used MySQL to analyze data, such as Create an ER diagram, Create a view, query using functions, and Create an index.
  The relevant code and material:

In the United_States_Airlines_Alalysis_Capstone_2 project, the objective of this project is to identify the factors that contribute to avoidable flight delays and to build a model to predict if the flight will be delayed. In the project, I used Pandas, Numpy, BeautifulSoup, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for EDA and Analysis, Sklearn for DecisionTreeClassifier, and Xgboost.

I studied and got a certificate for Machine Learning Specialization in Coursera, and the instructor is Andrew Ng.

The Fake News Classification aims to find out the fake news, it's used accumulative data, which could be used in news-based stock investment analysis. In the project, I compared the Sequential Model with Bi-Directional RNN and LSTM, the Decision Tree Model, and the Logistic Regression Model. I used Nltk, Tensorflow, Pandas, Matplotlib, Worldclud, Gensim, Keras, and Sklearn.
