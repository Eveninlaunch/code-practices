# code-practices
My code, data science, and machine learning practices begin from 2023 Aug.

In the car_rent_platform, it was my first time using Class in Python.
  The relevant code and material:

In the Cohorts of Songs project, I used Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for EDA and Cluster Analysis.
  The relevant code, data, and material:

In the ScienceQtech project, I used MySQL to analyze data, such as Create an ER diagram, Create a view, query using functions, and Create an index.
  The relevant code and material:

In the United_States_Airlines_Alalysis_Capstone_2 project, the objective of this project is to identify the factors that contribute to avoidable flight delays and to build a model to predict if the flight will be delayed. In the project, I used Pandas, Numpy, BeautifulSoup, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for EDA and Analysis, Sklearn for DecisionTreeClassifier, and Xgboost.
